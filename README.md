| **Backend Runtime** | **Node.js** | Server-side JavaScript runtime environment. |
| **Framework Web** | **Express.js** | Routing (GET, POST, etc.) and HTTP request handling. |
| **Base de Datos (NoSQL)** | **MongoDB** | Character data persistence. |
| **Driver DB** | **`mongodb`** | Direct connection and interaction with the database. |
